Welcome to Lantern
------------------

This project represents a prototype of an education/online text book
application.  It uses Django on Google App Engine. It requires Django version
1.0 or newer (developed with 1.1).

The initial application structure and setup is based sustantially on:

Running
-------

To run locally: *** YOU MUST INSTALL DJANGO 1.0 OR NEWER. ***

- Download Django-1.1.1.tar.gz (or newer, but not Django-1.2.X)
  from www.djangoproject.com and follow the installation instructions.
  Typically:

    cd /tmp
    tar xzf Django-1.1.1.tar.gz
    cd Django-1.1.1
    sudo python setup.py install

  This will install into your local machine's site-packages.

  NOTE: On the Mac, if you are using the Google App Engine Launcher, the
  Python version it uses may differ from the default you have on the
  command line.  To install Django into the correct Python version, you
  may have to do the following:

    sudo /usr/bin/python setup.py install

- Download the Google App Engine SDK from
  http://code.google.com/appengine/downloads.html.

  For convenience, extract it to a local directory (faster if not on NFS mount)
  and create a symbolic link to it from this directory, e.g.,:

    ln -s /usr/local/apps/google_appengine .google_appengine

  (Dotted files/directories are ignored by svn by default.)

- To run the application from this directory:

  .google_appengine/dev_appserver.py \
    --port 9090 \
    --address=<your_hostname> \
    .

  Access via http://<your_hostname>:9090.

  IMPORTANT: The server in the Google App Engine SDK is not designed for
  serving real traffic.  The App Engine FAQ at
  http://code.google.com/appengine/kb/general.html says about this:

   "You can override this using the -a <hostname> flag
    when running it, but doing so is not recommended because the SDK has
    not been hardened for security and may contain vulnerabilities."


- To deploy your own instance of the app to Google App Engine:

  1. Register your own application ID on the App Engine admin site.
  2. Edit app.yaml to use this app ID instead of 'codereview'.
  3. Upload using

    .google_appengine/appcfg.py update .

  *** Don't forget step 2!  If you forget to change the application ID,
  you'll get a error message from "appcfg.py update" complaining you don't
  have the right to administer this app.
